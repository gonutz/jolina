Download the [game here](https://github.com/gonutz/jolina/releases/).

This is a game I did in cooperation with my friend Jolina who is seven years
old at the time of this game. She helped me out with the graphics and sound for
this little soccer game.

The game runs on Windows only.

# Controls

Blue kiwi:

`A` `D`: move left/right

`W`: kick the ball

White kiwi:

`LEFT` `RIGHT`: move left/right

`UP`: kick the ball

There is also controller support, if you plug in one or two game controllers
before running the game, they will be recognized automatically. Use the
standard left/right axis for movement and press any key on the pad to kick the
ball.

# Build

You need the [Go programming language](https://go.dev/) and
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. Call `build.bat` to build the executable
`jolina.exe`.
